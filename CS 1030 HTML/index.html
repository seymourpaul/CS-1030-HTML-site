        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>My name is Seymour. I'm a transfer student from UT Austin, though I was only there for a semester and have lived in Utah for most of my life. </p>
        <h1>What do I like?</h1>
        <p>Late nights at the computer coding HTML because I'm irresponsible and didn't go to class. I'm also a biology double major, so I'm a big fan of animals and all that, raccoons especially. I played saxophone for four years in high school and love it. I also bought an electric guitar last week and just figured out how to play Smoke on the Water, so, yknow, I'm basically already Slash at this point tbh.</p>
